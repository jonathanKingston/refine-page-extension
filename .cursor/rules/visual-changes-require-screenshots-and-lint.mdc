## Rule: Visual changes must run screenshots + format + lint

If you make **any visual/UI change** (CSS, layout, colors, spacing, typography, HTML structure, or any behavior that changes what the extension renders), you MUST do all of the following before you finish:

- **Run the screenshot tool**: `npm run screenshots` (or a more specific scenario script like `npm run screenshots:homepage`, but default to `npm run screenshots` when unsure).
- **Run format**: `npm run format` to ensure code style consistency.
- **Run lint and fix issues**: `npm run lint` and fix all reported problems (do not leave new lint violations behind).

Fail fast:

- If screenshots fail, format fails, or lint fails, **stop** and fix them. Do not claim completion until all pass.
